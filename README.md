# DOMUpdater: DOM to DOM comparator and updater

DOMUpdater allows you to update an existing DOM structure by comparing it with a new one.

The aim of this library is to exploit a comparison DOM structure as if it were an updated Virtual DOM and consequently make changes to the existing DOM already visible in the document, thus trying to keep the existing DOM as unaltered as possible.
